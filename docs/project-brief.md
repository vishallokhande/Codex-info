# Project Brief: SeatSense Live

## What it is
SeatSense Live is a **ticketing-style discovery and booking platform** designed for large, spiky demand and a highly personalized user experience. It includes web and API layers, ML services for personalization and forecasting, and DevOps automation for reliability at scale.

## Why it exists
The platform was created to solve three big problems:
1. **User discovery**: Users need to find the right events quickly without scrolling for long.
2. **Operational scalability**: The platform must handle peak traffic and prevent seat overselling.
3. **Revenue optimization**: Organizers need demand insights and pricing guidance.

## Where it is used
- City cultural events, sports, and music venues.
- Corporate booking systems for internal events.
- Campus and community hubs that run recurring ticketed events.

## What makes it different
- AI/ML directly improves discovery, pricing decisions, and fraud prevention.
- DevOps automation reduces time-to-release and risk.
- Emphasis on observability and reliability from day one.

## Success criteria
- < 300ms search response time for 95% of requests.
- 99.9% booking success rate with seat integrity.
- Measurable uplift in conversion rate from personalization.

## Implementation phases (suggested)
1. **MVP**: Catalog + Search + Booking + basic UI.
2. **Phase 2**: Payment integration + seat locking + analytics.
3. **Phase 3**: ML recommendations + demand forecasting + fraud detection.
4. **Phase 4**: Optimization + dynamic pricing + multi-region expansion.
